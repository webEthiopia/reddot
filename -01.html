  <p class="title">Memories of Louis <br> Figo</p>
  <p class="p">He was born at Portugal. He started football by being promoted from the academy to the main club of Barcelona. When he was playing at Barcelona <b>Frantino perez (the manager of Real Madrid at that time)</b>was collecting what he called <b>“Galactico” (spanish for stars)</b>. He bought Figo from Barcelona. By the way that was the last purchase made between Barcelona and Real Madrid because they are competitors for lots of years. This remembers me of my dad buying those shirts that had his photo on them and he made me wear them. When Real Madrid and Barcelona had a game at <b>Lucamp (a stadium that belongs to Barcelona)</b> the fans of Barcelona bullied him by throwing heads of pigs and rotten oranges for signing into Madrid from Barcelona. He is the player that recived the most bullies in football’s history,but he survived and got sucessful at Real madrid. By the way my father is a fan of Figo from ethiopia.</p>
